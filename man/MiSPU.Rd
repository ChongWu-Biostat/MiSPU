\title{microbiome based sum of powered score (MiSPU)}
\usage{
MiSPU(y, X, tree, cov = NULL, resample = c("perm", "sim", "boot"),
      model = c("gaussian", "binomial"), pow = c(2:8, Inf), n.perm = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Outcome of interest. It can be a disease indicator; =0 for controls, =1 for cases.
Or it can be a quantitative trait. A vector with length n (number of observations).}
\item{X}{OTU count table, row - n sample, column - q OTU}
\item{tree}{Rooted phylogenetic tree of R class \dQuote{phylo}}
\item{cov}{Covariates. A matrix with dimension n by p (n :number of observation, p : number of covariates).}
\item{resample}{Use "perm" for residual permutations, "sim" for simulations from the null distribution, and "boot" for parametric bootstrap.}

\item{model}{Use "gaussian" for a quantitative trait, and use "binomial" for a binary trait.}

\item{pow}{The gamma which controls the weight. Larger pow puts more weight on the variables that have larger absolute score.}

\item{n.perm}{number of permutations or bootstraps.}
}
\value{
A list object, including the results for MiSPU_u, MiSPU_w and aMiSPU.

\description{
We propose a class of microbiome based sum of powered score (MiSPU) tests based on a newly defined generalized taxon proportion that combines observed microbial composition information with phylogenetic tree information. Different from the existing methods, a MiSPU test is based on a weighted score of the generalized taxon proportion in a general framework of regression, upweighting more likely to be associated microbial lineages. Our simulations demonstrated that one or more MiSPU tests were more powerful than MiRKAT while correctly controlling type I error rates. An adaptive MiSPU (aMiSPU) test is proposed to combine multiple MiSPU tests with various weights, approximating the most powerful MiSPU for a given scenario, consequently being highly adaptive and high powered across various scenarios.
