Description: There is an increasing interest in investigating how the compositions of microbial communities are associated with human health and disease. Although existing methods have identified many associations, a proper choice of a phylogenetic distance is critical for the power of these methods. In this package, we present a novel global testing method called aMiSPU, that is highly adaptive and thus high powered across various scenarios, alleviating the issue with the choice of a phylogenetic distance. Our simulations and real data analysis demonstrated that aMiSPU test was often more powerful than several competing methods while correctly controlling type I error rates.
